# python_template_706
create the Python Template project for Data Engineering Systems (IDS 706)

# This is the first assignment that introduces us to Github. As a part of that, we have to create two functions 'say_hello' and 'add'. The 'say_hello' function just returns a string which is a greeting message for MIDS first-year students welcoming them to the IDS 706 class. The 'add' function returns the sum of two integers (Two integers should be passed). There are a few test cases to see if the functions work well or not and the functions have passed the tests.
